## How It Works Now

### **Not Authenticated:**
```
Extension opens
  ↓
Shows modal overlay with login form
  ↓
User enters email/password
  ↓
Presses Enter or clicks "Sign In"
  ↓
Authenticates with backend
  ↓
Modal fades out → Shows main content
```

### **Already Authenticated:**
```
Extension opens
  ↓
Checks token in chrome.storage
  ↓
Verifies with backend
  ↓
Shows main content immediately (no modal)
```

### **Logout:**
```
Click "Logout" button
  ↓
Clears all auth data
  ↓
Shows login modal again
```
