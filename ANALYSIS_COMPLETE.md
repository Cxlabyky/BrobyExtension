# ✅ Backend Recording Analysis Complete

## What Was Analyzed

I've thoroughly analyzed the **BrobyVets backend repository** to understand the exact recording flow and API integration requirements.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Recording Token System** (CRITICAL)
- Backend generates a **special `recordingToken`** when creating sessions
- This token is **ultra-fast** (no database lookup, JWT-based)
- **MUST use recordingToken** for chunk uploads (not regular access_token)
- Performance optimization: 95% reduction in auth overhead

### 2. **Recording Flow**
```
1. Create consultation → consultationId
2. Create recording session → sessionId + recordingToken
3. Start MediaRecorder (15s chunks)
4. Upload chunks with recordingToken
5. Complete session (triggers summary)
6. Poll for summary (async generation)
```

### 3. **API Endpoints**
```
POST /recordings/sessions/new           → Create session
POST /recordings/sessions/:id/chunks    → Upload single chunk
POST /recordings/sessions/:id/chunks/batch → Upload batch (3-10 chunks)
POST /recordings/sessions/:id/complete  → Trigger summary generation
GET  /consultations/:id                 → Poll for summary
```

### 4. **Chunk Upload Format**
```javascript
FormData:
- audio: Blob (webm/opus format)
- chunkNumber: "0" (integer as string)
- sequenceOrder: "0" 
- duration: "15.5" (seconds as string)
- fileSize: "124234" (bytes as string)
```

### 5. **Audio Settings** (Recommended)
```javascript
{
  mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus',
  audioBitsPerSecond: 128000,  // 128kbps
  sampleRate: 48000,            // 48kHz
  chunkDuration: 15000          // 15 seconds
}
```

## Documentation Created

✅ **RECORDING_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md** - Complete 300+ line specification:
- Step-by-step API integration guide
- Code examples for every endpoint
- Error handling patterns
- Retry logic implementation
- Batch upload optimization
- Browser compatibility checks
- Performance metrics
- Security considerations

## Current Extension Status

### What's Already Built
✅ UI components (recording, processing, completed states)
✅ State management (transitions between states)
✅ Timer functionality (counts up, pause/resume)
✅ Auth system (login, token management)
✅ Patient detection (content script scraping)

### What's Missing (Next Steps)
❌ MediaRecorder integration
❌ Consultation creation API
❌ Recording session creation
❌ Chunk upload with retry logic
❌ Session completion
❌ Summary polling
❌ Real backend integration

## Next Implementation Phase

I can now implement the **actual recording functionality** with:
1. MediaRecorder service for audio capture
2. Chunk uploader with retry logic
3. Session manager for lifecycle
4. Summary polling system
5. Complete backend integration

**Ready to proceed with implementation?** The static UI is complete, and I have the exact backend specifications.
