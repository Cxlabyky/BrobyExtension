**Current Status**: The new recording UI is ready but needs extension reload to appear!

**What You'll See After Reload**:
- Same "Start Consult" button (this is correct - it's the ready state)
- When you click it, you'll see: timer, waveform animation, pause/submit buttons
- BUT: The JavaScript logic isn't wired up yet, so clicking won't do anything

**Next Step**: Wire up the JavaScript state transitions so clicking "Start Consult" actually shows the recording UI.
