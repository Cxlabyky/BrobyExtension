## ✅ All Fixes Applied

- [x] `api/consultation.service.js` - generateSummary() method added
- [x] `sidebar.js` - Calls generateSummary() before polling
- [x] `config.js` - All endpoints defined
- [x] Enhanced console logging

## 🧪 Test NOW

### 1. Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions → Find "BrobyVets" → Click reload icon 🔄
```

### 2. Open Extension
```
Navigate to any EzyVet patient page
Click BrobyVets extension icon
```

### 3. Start Recording
**Click "Start Consult"**

**Expected Console Logs:**
```
🎬 Starting recording workflow for: [Patient Name]
📝 Step 1: Creating consultation...
✅ Consultation created: [consultation-id]
🎤 Step 2: Creating recording session...
✅ Recording session created: [session-id]
🔑 Recording token received
🎙️ Step 3: Starting MediaRecorder...
✅ Recording started successfully!
```

**Every 15 seconds:**
```
📦 Received chunk [N], adding to upload queue
📤 Uploading chunk [N]...
✅ Chunk [N] uploaded successfully
```

### 4. Stop Recording (after 30+ seconds)
**Click "✓ Submit"**

**Expected Console Logs:**
```
🛑 Stopping recording...
⏳ Waiting for all uploads to complete...
✅ All chunks uploaded
🎯 Completing session...
✅ Session completed, summary generation started
✅ Recording submitted
🤖 Triggering AI summary generation...
```

**Wait 10-30 seconds, then:**
```
✅ Summary generated: 1234 characters
✅ Summary generated immediately
📝 Summary displayed in UI
```

### 5. Check Railway Backend Logs
**Should see these API calls:**
```
POST /api/v1/recordings/sessions/new
POST /api/v1/recordings/sessions/:id/chunks (multiple)
POST /api/v1/recordings/sessions/:id/complete
POST /api/v1/consultations/:id/generate-summary  ← KEY!
```

**Should see these logs:**
```
🎯 MOBILE COMPLETE: Session completion request
✅ MOBILE_DEBUG: Session stopped successfully
🤖 Generating AI summary
✅ Summary generated successfully
```

## 🔴 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Console Errors
Open browser console (F12), look for:
- ❌ Red error messages
- ❌ Failed fetch requests
- ❌ "TypeError" or "ReferenceError"

### Check 2: Network Tab
Open Network tab (F12 → Network):
- Filter by "consultations"
- Look for POST request to `/consultations/:id/generate-summary`
- Check response status (should be 200)
- Check response body (should have `summary` field)

### Check 3: Authentication
```javascript
// Run in browser console:
chrome.storage.local.get('access_token', console.log)
```
- Should show a valid JWT token
- If null/undefined → Login again

### Check 4: Consultation ID
```javascript
// Run in browser console after recording:
console.log('App:', window.app)
```
- Should show `consultationId` property
- If undefined → Recording didn't save consultationId

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### SUCCESS:
1. Recording uploads chunks ✅
2. Click Submit ✅
3. Shows "Generating AI Summary..." ✅
4. **10-30 seconds later** ✅
5. Summary appears formatted ✅

### FAILURE (Old Behavior):
1. Recording uploads chunks ✅
2. Click Submit ✅
3. Shows "Generating AI Summary..." ✅
4. **Waits forever** ❌
5. Never shows summary ❌

## 📊 Debug Commands

### Check Current State
```javascript
// In browser console:
chrome.storage.local.get(null, console.log)
```

### Test Summary Generation Manually
```javascript
// In browser console (replace with your consultation ID):
ConsultationService.generateSummary('your-consultation-id-here')
  .then(result => {
    console.log('Result:', result);
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('Summary length:', result.summary.length);
      console.log('Summary preview:', result.summary.substring(0, 200));
    }
  });
```

### Check Backend Connectivity
```javascript
// In browser console:
fetch('https://backend-production-a35dc.up.railway.app/api/v1/consultations', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + (await chrome.storage.local.get('access_token')).access_token
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log);
```

## 🔧 If It Doesn't Work

Share with me:
1. **Browser console logs** (full output from start to finish)
2. **Railway backend logs** (filter for your consultation ID)
3. **Network tab** (screenshot of failed requests)
4. **Any error messages** (full error text)

I'll debug further and fix any remaining issues!
