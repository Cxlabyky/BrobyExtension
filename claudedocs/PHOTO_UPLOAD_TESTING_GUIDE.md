## Debugging Tips

```

### Common Issues

**Photos not showing:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify consultationId is set
- Check network tab for API responses

**Upload fails:**
- Check file size (<10MB)
- Check file type (image/*)
- Verify auth token is valid
- Check network connectivity

**Delete not working:**
- Verify backend endpoint exists
- Check auth headers
- Look for 404/403 errors

**Counter wrong:**
- Check `this.photos` array in console
- Verify `updatePhotoCount()` called
- Check badge element exists

4. Start/stop consultation multiple times

### Expected Behavior
